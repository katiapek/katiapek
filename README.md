# 👋 Hi, I'm Kamil Kałużny  

Python Developer | ex. Nuclear Power Plant Engineer  

I bring **9+ years of engineering experience** from the construction and commissioning of the **Olkiluoto 3 EPR Nuclear Power Plant** — from **electrical supervision** through **method engineering** to **I&C commissioning**.  
Now I apply the same rigor to **Python development, data analysis, and trading futures**.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **AutoBizOps** — a full-stack app automating business operations.  
- 🌱 I’m learning by **building as much as I can around my stack** and exploring DevOps through **TechWorld with Nana**.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects with **great people onboard**.  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **practice, code reviews, and sharpening my developer workflow**.

## Learning Roadmap

I’m actively expanding my skills through a structured path that balances **practical coding projects** with **new technologies**:

- 🔹 **Strengthen the Basics** → Deeper mastery of Python, SQL, Flask/Django, Docker, Git  
- 🔹 **Machine Learning** → TensorFlow/Keras, building and training practical ML models  
- 🔹 **Big Data** → PySpark for distributed data processing and analytics  
- 🔹 **DevOps & Automation** → CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, containerization, Terraform for infrastructure as code  
- 🔹 **Portfolio Projects** → Applying each new skill in open-source apps and tools shared here on GitHub
