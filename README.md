# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kamil KaÅ‚uÅ¼ny  

Python Developer | ex. Nuclear Power Plant Engineer  

I bring **9+ years of engineering experience** from the construction and commissioning of the **Olkiluoto 3 EPR Nuclear Power Plant** â€” from **electrical supervision** through **method engineering** to **I&C commissioning**.  
Now I apply the same rigor to **Python development, data analysis, and trading futures**.
